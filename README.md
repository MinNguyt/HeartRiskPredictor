# HeartRiskPredictor

A machine learning project designed to **predict the risk of heart disease** based on clinical and lifestyle data.  
This project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple ML algorithms to identify people at high risk for cardiovascular diseases.

## Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
By using data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project aims to:
- Build a predictive model for heart disease risk.
- Support early detection and preventive healthcare.
- Demonstrate how data-driven insights can improve medical decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
